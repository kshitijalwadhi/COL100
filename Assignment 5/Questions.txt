EDIT: Use CPU timer instead of real timer to better capture the time spent in computation and ignore the time spent in printing the output.
EDIT: Added helper file for timer and data generation.

- Develop a SML function for Merge sort and establish its correctness.

- Compare run times of Mergesort and Insertion sort on large data-sets by plotting
your results (Time vs listSize).  We will provide the functions for
timer and data generation.

- Develop SML function for adding, subtracting and multiplying two integers whose
digits are stored in lists. For example: integer number 123 is stored as
3::2::1. Establish the correctness of your solutions.
