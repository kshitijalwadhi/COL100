Q1. Develop a higher order function and show its use in computing
 fastpower (from Assign1), perfect numbers(from Assign1), and e^x up
 to some n-th term.

Q2. Problem 6 (pg 105 of the Lecture Notes). 

Q3. Problem 2 (pg 125 of the Lecture Notes).

Q4. Develop a higher-order function and use it to compute
a) x^n in O(log n) steps
b) multiply a*b in O(log b) steps (Q1 part 3 of Minor 1)
c) dividing an integer x >= 0 by another interger y > 0 to determine q and r such that x = q*y + r, 0 <= r  < y, in O(log x ) steps (Q3 of Minor 1)
